This repository is the official implementation of [Extending Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Neural Networks with Differentiable Contact Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06794). 

You are in the archive branch. This branch is the original implementation that produces the results and figures in the paper. However, the system names in the code is different from the system names in the paper. 

You might want to check out the following notebooks, which produces the figures in the paper.
